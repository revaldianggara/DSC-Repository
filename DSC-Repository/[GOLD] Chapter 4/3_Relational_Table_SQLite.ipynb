    "# 3. Relational Table on SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "## SELECT statements\n",
    "\n",
    "A SELECT statement retrieves zero or more rows from one or more database tables or views. It is the most commonly used data query language command. A basic SELECT statement syntax looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "    SELECT * (or column1, column2, …)\n",
    "\n",
    "    FROM table_name (or view_name);\n",
    "```\n",
    "The SELECT statement has many optional clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **WHERE** — specifies which row(s) to be retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GROUP BY** — groups rows sharing a property so that an aggregate function can be applied to each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **HAVING** — selects among the groups defined by the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ORDER BY** — specifies an order in which to return the rows; either ascending or descending.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AS** — provides an alias which can be used to temporarily rename tables or columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other clauses used to filter data were considered in the SELECT statement such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LIMIT** — restricts the number of rows to be returned to the amount specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **BETWEEN** — tests whether a value is in a range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **IN** — checks if a value matches any value in a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LIKE** — queries data based on pattern matching using wildcard characters: percent sign(%) and underscore(_).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **DISTINCT** — returns only the unique rows from a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## SQL Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "An aggregate function allows one to perform a calculation on set of values to return a single scalar value. We often use aggregate functions with the GROUP BY and HAVING clauses of the SELECT statement. The commonly used ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **AVG** — calculates the average of a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **COUNT** — counts rows in a specified table or row.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MIN** — gets the minimum value in a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **MAX** — gets the maximum value in a set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SUM** — calculates the sum of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used modifier **(DISTINCT or ALL)** when using aggregate functions. **DISTINCT** modifier when used, ignores duplicate values and considers only unique values. ALL modifier which is the default if one does not specify, uses all values for calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a common column. The condition you want to be met would determine which of the join types you would use. There are four basic types of SQL joins: inner, left, right, and full.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **INNER JOIN** — Returns records that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **LEFT (OUTER) JOIN** — Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN** — Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FULL (OUTER) JOIN** — Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other join functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **CROSS JOIN** — produces a result set which is the number of rows in the first table multiplied by the number of rows in the second table if now WHERE clause is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SELF JOIN** — joins a table to itself to create a result set that joins rows with other rows within the same table.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **`customers`** table stores customers data.\n",
    "* **`invoices`** & **`invoice_items`** tables: these two tables store invoice data. <br>The **`invoices`** table stores invoice header data and the **`invoice_items`** table stores the invoice line items data.\n",
    "* **`artists`** table stores artists data. It is a simple table that contains only the artist id and name.\n",
    "* **`albums`** table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.\n",
    "* **`media_types`** table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.\n",
    "* **`genres`** table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.\n",
    "* **`tracks`** table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.\n",
    "* **`playlists`** & **`playlist_track`** tables: playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the **`playlists`** table and **`tracks`** table is many-to-many. The **`playlist_track`** table is used to reflect this relationship.\n",
